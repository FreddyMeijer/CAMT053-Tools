# CAMT053 Tools
Welcome to the CAMT053 tools repo. I am Freddy Meijer and at the time business engineer at Leiden. In a Betty Blocks application we retrieve information from the bank in a CAMT053 XML file. In this repo you find serveral tools to work with those files.
## Installation
To install the CAMT053 Tools al you need to do is:

- Download and install an instance of Python
- Open your terminal navigate to the desired folder and use `git clone https://github.com/FreddyMeijer/CAMT053-Tools.git`
- Open the folder in which the git was cloned
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the desired function by using e.g. `python CAMT053ExtractTotals.py`
## .gitignore
The gitignore file states that .csv and .xml files will not be uploaded through git. The information in the files is personal en thereby protected under GDPA regulations. So the files itself should never be uploaded on GitHub.
